Investment firms, hedge funds and even individuals have been using financial models to better understand market behaviour and make profitable investments and trades. A wealth of information is available in the form of historical stock prices and company performance data, suitable for machine learning algorithms to process. However, it's important to note that predicting stock prices accurately is a challenging task, and there are many factors that can affect stock prices that may not be accounted for in the data used to train the model. While historical stock prices and company performance data can be used as inputs for the model, they may not fully capture all the factors that can impact stock prices, such as macroeconomic factors, political events, and unexpected news.
The algorithms can capture the patterns and trends in the data over time and can be trained to make predictions based on historical data. It's important to carefully select the optimal parameters for the model to ensure it produces accurate predictions. Additionally, it's important to visualize both the predicted price values over time and the optimal parameters for the model to help interpret and validate the results.
